## About Me

I am a Lecturer in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the [Centre for Decision Research](https://cdr.leeds.ac.uk/), [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). In March 2019, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science under the supervision of [Dr. Ke Chen](https://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~kechen/index.php) from the Machine Learning and Optimization Group, School of Computer Science, [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). From 2019 to 2023, I served as a Research Fellow in Machine Learning at the Maths Group of the EPSRC Future Advanced Metrology Hub. All my experiences center around adopting machine learning to tackle real-world problems. 

My research interests include machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), artificial intelligence (AI), and their real-world applications, particularly in sustainable manufacturing, design for additive manufacturing, and production research. I have been conducting research in machine learning for over ten years and have authored or co-authored {{site.publications | size}} papers in leading journals in my field, such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, Virtual and Physical Prototyping, Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing, Computers & Industrial Engineering, and Cognitive Computation. For details, please visit my [Publications](index.html#publications) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qQuCvmQAAAAJ) pages.
